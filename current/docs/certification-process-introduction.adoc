== About the *Connector Lifecycle Model*

As previously mentioned, this lifecycle consists in the following stages:

//The partner Engagement and Certification Process for publishing connectors consists of these stages:

== Stage 1: On-Board

This first stage consists mainly on the legal matters involving the development of a connector for MuleSoft. This stage includes as well a learning phase of the default framework for developing connectors, the Anypoint™ Connector DevKit.

=== 1.1 Legal Engagement

Both sides, MuleSoft and a Service Integrator (_SI_), state the guidelines and expected product before starting development.


//During the development process, MuleSoft and a third-party partner, based on a pre-existing partnership agreement, begin the development process.

=== 1.2 Learning Anypoint™ Connector DevKit

The MuleSoft Anypoint™ Connector DevKit is the default tool for developing Anypoint connectors. It provides a vast set of features to help you develop and further mantain your connector. Features include, but are not limited to:

. Visual design and implementation using Anypoint Studio with an Eclipse-oriented interface that simplifies and speed up development
. Maven support for development and building
. Connector development and packaging tools
. Authentication support for multiple types of authentication like OAuth and Basic Authentication
. DataSense support to acquire metadata from endpoints
. Extensive testing capability
. Examples, training, and support to simplify startup
. Provides batch, query pagination, and DataSense Query Language support

== Stage 2: Development



The development stage is one of the two major phases, mostly occurring in the development team side. Since the Mulesoft team have relatively low control of this stage, we require every developer to follow a strict set of practices, which we called *Mandatory Practices*.

=== 2.1 Design Specification Review

The _design specification review_ phase, within the development stage, primary assists developers and designers to clarify the functional behaviour of the connector, provides extensive use cases, ranging from normal ones to border-cases ones, and finally includes an overall architecture design. It is strongly recommended that developers, as well as designers, consider this step as mandatory, taking into consideration the _Design Specification Document_, available at:

https://github.com/mulesoft/connector-certification-docs/blob/docs/current/attachments/templates/designSpecificationTemplate.adoc[Design Specification Template]


This design specification document is one of the two _Exit Criteria Documents_ needed by the Mulesoft team. The second document is a _Certification Checklist Document_, which corroborates that every mandatory practice have been accomplished and every deliverable have been issued. This ckecklist need to be completed before submitting the connector for certification. The checklist is available at:

=== 2.2 Mandatory Practices

These practices assure an overall product quality, ranging from coding standars to documentation. The Mulesoft team requires every practice to be strictly followed by the development team and to produce the required deliverables, such as release notes.

== Stage 3: Certification

The certification stage, on the contrary to the development stage, occurs mostly in the Mulesoft side. This includes different high-level objectives, such as:

. Automated code scan
. Manual code review and black box testing
. Manual and automated tests review
. Repository structure review
. Documentation review
. Runtime-compatibility review
. Static code analysis


Certification includes a prerequisites step, where a wide set of properties are checked and validated. These properties includes GitHub credentials, Maven dependencies and versioning, among others.


=== 3.1 Prerequisites

Before the Mulesoft team starts the certification stage, there are a set of prerequisites to be satisfied:

* *Design Specification Approved:* The Design Specification Document has been approved and all suggested corrections have been taken into consideration.
* *Source Code Access and Sandbox Credentials:* As part of the certification process, the MuleSoft team will internally run a continue build tests execution and run a set of code inspections to validate the quality of the connector. The following actions are required:
** GitHub account read access must be granted to the user connectors-cert-ci (connectors-cert-ci at mulesoft dot com).
** In case of being required, provide the Sandbox credentials used for the testing execution.
** Create a release branch that will contain all the fixes and suggested produced during the certification process. It should follows the naming convention "release/v<version-number>". Once the certification process has been completed, all the changes will be merged into the master branch and a tag, with all the change, need to be created. It's strongly encourage to follow GitFlow branching practices.
* *Maven Dependencies:*
** The connector must be a final version, It could not be an SNAPSHOT
** There must not be any SNAPSHOT dependencies
** External dependencies must be located in well know public repositories.
* *Presentation Demo:* The objective of this demo is to go over the functional aspects of the connectors, overview of the system to be connected and underlying integration technology (REST/WSDL/SDK). The audience of this meeting will mainly be Product Managers, Connectors Engineers Leads and QA members.
* *Complete <<certification-checklist,Certification Checklist>> *
* *Connector documentation:* There must be a public access to the connectors documentation.
* *Versioning:* Connectors must follow versioning best practices. Given a version number MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH increment MAJOR version when you make incompatible API changes, increment MINOR version when you add functionality in a backwards-compatible manner, and increment PATCH version when you make backwards-compatible bug fixes.

=== 3.2 Certification

Once all the previous steps have been completed, The MuleSoft team will start the certification process, which is by nature an iterative process. The Mulesoft team in charge will reporte different recommendations, which should be taken into consideration by the connector development team, otherwise the certification will fail.

The Mulesoft team will define a tentative starting date for the certification process, where we strongly recommend that the connector developer team allocate different time windows to respond to our recommendations. Once all the recommendations have been resolved and implemented, the certification process ends. However, if there is no active engagement in solving the reported recommendations within a seven-days period, the whole certification process will be suspended and a new tentative starting date will be defined.

The Mulesoft team provides a CloudBees (http://www.cloudbees.com) dedicated account that the connector development team can use to monitor tests executions and static code analysis reports.

It is important to mention that the main communication channel between the Mulesoft team and the connector team is the Mulesoft connector forum, part of the Mulesoft forum community.


//MuleSoft reserves the right to conduct random tests on published connectors. If we find a connector that deviates from any of our requirements, we notify you and provide a //timeframe to remedy the issue. In extreme cases, we may remove the connector from our web site.

// @Todo: Define new releases criteria.


=== 3.3 Results





* *Support Training:* Mule Support team will provide T1 support and will help the customer to isolated the issue and identify it if the issue is a Mule issue or a connector issue. The objective of this birth view training is to provide to the support team a general understanding of the connector and tools that help to isolate the problem.


* *Upload to Mulesoft Connector Library:* Certified connector will be upload in the https://www.mulesoft.com/library[Mule Connectors Library]. After your connector passes the certification process, MuleSoft sends you an estimated date for when your connector will appear on the MuleSoft web site. As part of this process, the following information need to be provided:

** High level description of the connector. 
*** https://www.mulesoft.com/library#!/salesforce-integration-connector?types=connector[SalesForce Connector] could be used as template example. 

** URL to Release Notes

** URL to Functional documentation of the connector

** URL to DevKit generated documentation


== Stage 4: Publishing

The final stage in the connector lifecycle model is Publishing, which is mainly carried out in the Mulesoft team side. Once the certification process has been successfully completed, the connector will be deployed and published in the Mulesoft Connector Library.




== Release Re-Certification

Mule ESB and Anypoint Studio have a release cycle of three month, where the Mulesoft team needs to assure that previously published connectors keep working in new releases. Due to class-loading issues and data-mapping problems, already published connectors might not work in new Mule ESB versions. Therefore, prior to Mule ESB and Anypoint Studio releases, regression tests need to be run in order to assure full forward compatibility.

If regression testing fails, it is up to the connector development team to decide whether the connector will support or not newer versions of Mule ESB and Anypoint Studio.

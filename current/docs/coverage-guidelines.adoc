== Code Coverage and SonarQube

SonarQube is a tool that helps developers identify hot spots in code, bad code quality, technical debt, as well as define a number of other issues. To release a connector, you must fix blocker and critical issues.

Important: Only download SonarQube from here because the distribution contains code guidelines specifically for Anypoint Cloud Connectors. To release a connector, test every message processor in the connector using the Connector Test Framework. For guidelines on how to build your tests using this framework, see Functional QA Guidelines.

Generate a code coverage report in SonarQube with this command:

----
mvn clean org.jacoco:jacoco-maven-plugin:prepare-agent install 
	-Dmaven.test.failure.ignore=true && mvn sonar:sonar
----

After this command finishes executing, Sonar displays a report with the name of your connector. For example, this screenshot shows the Salesforce connector’s Sonar report after running every Unit test and Functional test:

Delving further into the project details shows you a code coverage percentage on a per-class basis.

Delving even further, it shows you the exact lines that are covered by tests and those that are not.

Every connector method must have unit or automation tests. A connector fails certification if it does not have all its message processors, message sources, and custom transformers covered by unit tests or automation tests. Also, all the utility classes that are part of a connector must have a high level of code coverage. 

=== Code coverage must be no less than 60%.

Testing your processors gives you a good indication of the quality of your connector. When you build automation tests, you are using your own connector to connect to an API. If you find it hard to test all cases of a message processor, then consider separating your message processors into smaller ones, if possible. 

If your connector bases its processing around metadata, test every possible metadata entry that the API supports. As an example, the Salesforce connector supports multiple SFDC objects (such as Account, Contact, Lead etc.), but it only contains one “create” operation. Create a unit test for every metadata object to ensure proper compatibility with the message processor.

== Studio Plugin Code Coverage Report

The Studio DevKit plugin rapidly generates a coverage report that shows you which operations are covered by functional tests and those that are not. 

To generate a coverage report, run every functional test in your connector. Right-click your project name in Package Explorer and click *Anypoint Connector > Test Coverage Report*.

A Maven build process generates an HTML page that lists all the operations your tests cover and those without coverage:

=== Ignoring Classes from Testing

You should *NEVER* prevent classes from being tested unless there is good reason. If you feel that there is a need to ignore classes from inspection, contact either Mariano Quintela, or Paulo Gustavo Veiga. Unless explicitly stated in the code comments or in some form of internal documentation, assume that all code must be inspected. Any ignored classes or packages without proper explanation should be inspected and any blocker or critical issues that arise should be resolved, *and tested* by the developer before the connector is released.

There are a number of ways of ignoring classes that you do not want inspected by SonarQube:
	
* Method level ignore:  
** Methods can be ignored by adding a //NOSONAR comment next to the method declaration. Example:

[source,java]
----	
public void someMethodToNotInspect() { //NOSONAR
----
* Class level ignore
** It may be the case that whole classes need to be ignored because they’re not in the control of the developer. As an example, the SFDC Connector contains classes from the SFDC JAR. These had to be modified slightly to include no-args constructors for DataSense reasons. As a result, these classes have to be ignored since the code quality is not in control of the SFDC Connector developer. 

** Classes can be completely ignored by adding // NOSONAR next to the class level definition. Example:

[source,java]
----	
public class MyClassThatShouldntBeInspected { // NOSONAR
----

* Package level ignore
** Whole packages can be ignored by adding the “sonar.exclusions” property inside the pom.xml file. Example:

[source,xml]
----	
<properties>
	<sonar.exclusions>src/main/java/com/sforce/**/*</sonar.exclusions>
</properties>
----

This ignores any file under the com.sforce package under src/main/java. 


== Code Quality Review Guideline

This is a hard area to tackle because typically, the person running certification is different from the one implementing the connector and writing tests for it. As a result, you might inspect the code and be completely lost. 

If code documentation is not sufficient, point this out to the developer and PM.

As you try to understand the code, you might run into certain code pieces that you’re not sure why they’re there. As an example, PeopleSoft contained synchronous code and some time was spent by the developer understanding why they were there. It turns out that they were not needed, and were causing a degree of locking when working with concurrent requests. If you think that there are code blocks that feel out of place, mention it to the developer or PM.

Most automatic validations on your connector’s code are done with SonarQube, an open source static code analysis tool that helps developers identify hot spots in code, bad code quality, technical debt, as well as define a number of other issues. To release a connector, you must fix blocker and critical issues.

To perform these validations yourself, install and configure a the SonarQube server that we provide with rules specific to the certification process. If you are certifying multiple connectors, you can reuse the same server.

Note: For guidelines on how to build your tests using this framework, see <<functional-tests-automation,Automated Functional Testing>>

== Installing SonarQube

The quickest way to get SonarQube up and running is to install it locally with an embedded database. If you wish to use a standalone database or a more advanced configuration, see the related SonarQube Eclipse Plugin Setup documentation.

You need a server running Oracle JRE 6 or higher. (OpenJRE or other distributions are not supported by SonarQube.)

. Download and extract the latest version of http://www.sonarqube.org/downloads[SonarQube](all platforms).
. Run __<installDir>/bin/<yourOS>/sonar.sh start__ or __<installDir>\bin\<yourOS>\StartSonar.bat__ if on Windows. The server might take a while to start even after the “Started SonarQube” message appears.
. Browse to http://localhost:9000.
. Log in with the following credentials:
.. Username: admin
.. Password: admin
. Download our https://drive.google.com/uc?export=download&id=0B8N265C555thaXBSV256SkZtMlk[Custom Quality Profile]
. Go to the *Quality Profiles* tab and Click *Create*.
. Then choose the https://drive.google.com/uc?export=download&id=0B8N265C555thaXBSV256SkZtMlk[Quality Profile] file that you downloaded, name it "Anypoint Connectors Profile" and click *Create*.
. When you see the profile in the list click in *Set as Default*.
. Finally you need to set the exclusions, to set this go to *Settings* and click *Exclusions*.
. In the *Code Coverage* tab add __target/**__
. Click *Add Value*  and click *Save Code Coverage Settings*.
. In the *Files* tab add __target/**__ under __Global Source File Exclusions__ and __Global Test File Exclusions__.
. Finally, click *Add Value* in both and click *Save Files Settings*.

== Performing Your First Analysis

For the first run of your project, go to the project’s root folder and run:
----
mvn clean org.jacoco:jacoco-maven-plugin:prepare-agent test -Dmaven.test.failure.ignore=true
	-Dtest=RegressionTestSuite -D<connector>_CREDENTIALS=automation-credentials.properties
&& mvn install && mvn sonar:sonar

mvn clean org.jacoco:jacoco-maven-plugin:prepare-agent install
	-Dmaven.test.failure.ignore=true
&& mvn sonar:sonar
----

This creates the project in your sonar installation, allowing you to use the Eclipse SonarQube plugin from inside your Anypoint™ Studio. Using this plugin is the recommended way, but is always possible to run the inspections manually with * mvn sonar:sonar *.

If you are experiencing false positive issues, you can disable the inspection using //NOSONAR comment at the end of a line which has the issue on a case-by-case basis. Every use of //NOSONAR is recorded by SonarQube as an Info issue so you can track its usage in your connector’s code.

NOTE: The use of //NOSONAR comments should only be used when there is full certainty that this inspection is a false positive.

For example, suppose you have an incorrectly capitalized method that you can’t change. This is normally a blocker issue:

After adding the //NOSONAR marker, this is no longer a blocker issue, but is marked as Info so you can track the usage of //NOSONAR throughout your project:

== SonarQube Eclipse Plugin Setup

. Open Anypoint™ Studio, then select Help > Install New Software.

image::{imagesdir}/sonar-3.png[]


. In the Work with text box, fill in the update site URL:
SonarQube Integration for Eclipse (update-site) - http://dist.sonar-ide.codehaus.org/eclipse/

image::{imagesdir}/sonar-4.png[]


. Check the SonarQube Java option.
. After completing the installation, restart Anypoint™ Studio.
. Open Anypoint™ Studio’s preferences, and browse to the SonarQube section. Expand it, and select the Servers subsection. Click Add and fill in the URL and credentials for your server (by default, admin/admin).

image::{imagesdir}/sonar-5.png[]

Click the *Test connection* button to ensure that your settings are correct.

. To associate your project on the SonarQube server, perform a full analysis once. You can do this by running mvn sonar:sonar in your Connector project.

You should perform this full analysis from a machine that is on the same network as the SonarQube database, otherwise it might take very long to complete.

When your project finishes analyzing, in Studio right-click your connector project and click *Configure > Associate with SonarQube*. Because your project was analyzed with Maven, the association detects automatically.

image::{imagesdir}/sonar-6.png[]

. After association, your project is analysed with SonarQube and the results are shown on the SonarQube issues tab. Also, the Package Explorer and file editor display error and warning icons according to the issues on your project.

New issues introduced since the previous analysis are marked as errors, while existing issues are marked as warnings. This is a cosmetic difference only, which helps to highlight new technical debt being introduced in your code before you check it in.

. To analyse your project again, right-click it and click *SonarQube > Analyse*.

== Quality Profile Rules
SonarQube classifies each issue with a severity:

* Blocker & Critical: Bugs or unacceptable programming practices. Your connector cannot have blocker or Critical issues to be certified. You must correct all issues.
* Major:  These inspections fall in a similar category to the critical issues but with lower priority.
* Minor: Correctness, clarity or performance issues that do not impact your connector’s functionality significantly.
* Info: Keeps track of useful information that might otherwise go unnoticed.

To see the full list of rules checked by SonarQube, browse to the Anypoint™ Connectors Certification quality profile through the web UI.


== Code Coverage

SonarQube also lets you manage Code Coverage reports of your connector.

Generate a code coverage report in SonarQube with this command:

----
mvn clean org.jacoco:jacoco-maven-plugin:prepare-agent install
	-Dmaven.test.failure.ignore=true && mvn sonar:sonar
----

After this command finishes executing, Sonar displays a report with the name of your connector. For example, this screenshot shows the Salesforce connector’s Sonar report after running every Unit test and Functional test:

image::{imagesdir}/coverage-guidelines-1.png[]

Delving further into the project details shows you a code coverage percentage on a per-class basis.

image::{imagesdir}/coverage-guidelines-2.png[]

Delving even further, it shows you the exact lines that are covered by tests and those that are not.

image::{imagesdir}/coverage-guidelines-3.png[]

Every connector method must have unit or automation tests. A connector fails certification if it does not have all its message processors, message sources, and custom transformers covered by unit tests or automation tests. Also, all the utility classes that are part of a connector must have a high level of code coverage.

=== Code coverage must be no less than 70%.

Testing your processors gives you a good indication of the quality of your connector. When you build automation tests, you are using your own connector to connect to an API. If you find it hard to test all cases of a message processor, then consider separating your message processors into smaller ones, if possible.

If your connector bases its processing around metadata, test every possible metadata entry that the API supports. As an example, the Salesforce connector supports multiple SFDC objects (such as Account, Contact, Lead etc.), but it only contains one “create” operation. Create a unit test for every metadata object to ensure proper compatibility with the message processor.

=== Ignoring Classes from Testing

You should *NEVER* prevent classes from being tested unless there is good reason. If you feel that there is a need to ignore classes from inspection, contact either Mariano Quintela, or Paulo Gustavo Veiga. Unless explicitly stated in the code comments or in some form of internal documentation, assume that all code must be inspected. Any ignored classes or packages without proper explanation should be inspected and any blocker or critical issues that arise should be resolved, *and tested* by the developer before the connector is released.

There are a number of ways of ignoring classes that you do not want inspected by SonarQube:

* Method level ignore:
** Methods can be ignored by adding a //NOSONAR comment next to the method declaration. Example:

[source,java]
----
public void someMethodToNotInspect() { //NOSONAR
----
* Class level ignore
** It may be the case that whole classes need to be ignored because they’re not in the control of the developer. As an example, the SFDC Connector contains classes from the SFDC JAR. These had to be modified slightly to include no-args constructors for DataSense reasons. As a result, these classes have to be ignored since the code quality is not in control of the SFDC Connector developer.

** Classes can be completely ignored by adding // NOSONAR next to the class level definition. Example:

[source,java]
----
public class MyClassThatShouldntBeInspected { // NOSONAR
----

* Package level ignore
** Whole packages can be ignored by adding the “sonar.exclusions” property inside the pom.xml file. Example:

[source,xml]
----
<properties>
	<sonar.exclusions>src/main/java/com/sforce/**/*</sonar.exclusions>
</properties>
----

This ignores any file under the com.sforce package under src/main/java.


== Code Quality Review Guideline

This is a hard area to tackle because typically, the person running certification is different from the one implementing the connector and writing tests for it. As a result, you might inspect the code and be completely lost.

If code documentation is not sufficient, point this out to the developer and PM.

As you try to understand the code, you might run into certain code pieces that you’re not sure why they’re there. As an example, PeopleSoft contained synchronous code and some time was spent by the developer understanding why they were there. It turns out that they were not needed, and were causing a degree of locking when working with concurrent requests. If you think that there are code blocks that feel out of place, mention it to the developer or PM.

== Code Conventions

This sections covers the following areas:

Standard Java Coding Conventions
. DevKit Standards and Best Practices
. Maven Conventions and Setup
. Connector Demo Example

It's important to point out that in the following steps of the certification most of this practices will be validated using automated tools such as SonarQue.

== Standard Java Coding Conventions

=== Static Analysis Rules

We have defined as set of static inspections rules that are enforced by SonarQube. This rules are aimed to detect potential bugs and bad coding practices.
More details about this could be found in the section <<static-code-analysis-and-coverage,Static Code Analysis & Code Coverage>>

== Maven Conventions and Setup

The following section describes set of conventions and best practices to follow at the time to define your connector Maven project structure.

=== Best Practices
Despite a connector's code could be 100% sure, and it works perfectly fine in an isolated environment, every connector we build must work in a Mule environment.

This means that a some constraints could apply, here are the key ones:

* Follow http://maven.apache.org/guides/introduction/introduction-to-the-standard-directory-layout.html[Maven default name conventions] 
* Do not overwrite org.mule.tools.devkit:mule-devkit-parent properties.
* Do not reference SNAPSHOT dependencies either in plugins or dependencies.

=== *Avoid caching*
Connectors should not hold state, unless is strictly necessary. Several APIs are actually hosted in cloud environments, and therefore caching states ends up in having untrusted data in the connector.
There are a few cases where the connector might need to save some data of the current API while working on it, which leads into caching.

For those scenarios where *the connector needs caching no matter what, the following code should be used*:

[source,java]
----
// 1) the connector ask for the manager of the Object Store
@Inject
protected ObjectStoreManager objectStoreManager;
----
And then use the manager to get/create a custom Object Store as follow:
[source,java]
----
// 2) the connector ask mule for the Object Store represented by "some ID"
ObjectStore<? extends Serializable> os = objectStoreManager.getObjectStore("some ID");
// 3) then it uses it
os.store("key", "value");
----

Other way to achieve caching could be through temporal files, but it might depend on the use case.

=== *Avoid spawning threads*
Same as caching, spawning threads is not recommended in a connector as a common API lives in the cloud. This means that a connector won't improve its throughput with more threads, because every communication with the API means more HTTP requests/responses. Although we don't recommend using threads, as caching, there might be custom cases where they are actually needed.

For those scenarios where *the connector needs to spawn threads* you should use a http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/concurrent/ExecutorService.html[Executor Service].

=== *Reading resources from within the connector*
When reading resources that are bundled with the connector, the usual `getClass().getResourceAsStream("custom-file-to-read.txt")` will work great. But if the file `"custom-file-to-read.txt"` can actually be parametrized through the mule application, then other mechanism should be used.

Let's say that for your connector, a file can be feeded from the src/main/resources folder (again, this file comes from Studio, not from the connector), the following code should be used:
[source,java]
----
// 1) the connector ask for the manager of the mule context
@Inject
protected MuleContext muleContext;
----
Then read the resources as follow:
[source,java]
----
ClassLoader classLoader = muleContext.getExecutionClassLoader();
URL resourceURL = classLoader.getResource("custom-file-to-read.txt");
----
Where `"custom-file-to-read.txt"` is the file to be read from the mule app in `src/main/resources/custom-file-to-read.txt`.

=== *Mule dependencies*
Adding dependencies in your connector should be careful task, as it might collide with mule ones.
So, a few constraints might apply, such as:

1. When adding mule artefacts, always use `<scope>provided</scope>`
2. When adding artefacts that might collide with mule, choose the versions that are in the current mule version your connector is going to work with. Some of those artefacts are: cxf, jersey, spring, guava, etc.

=== *Shading*
For some corner cases, you might need to add a dependency that does collide with mule ones. For those scenarios, we strongly recommend you to use the same version of the library as mule does, and if this is an impossible taks, then change your library to another one.
If you still need that custom library that collides with mule, then shading could work for you.

You need to modify your connector's `pom.xml` file to add the shading plugin in order to achieve 2 things: 1) add the custom jar into the connector's one and 2) rename the packages of the library into a new one in order to avoid collisions.

The following snippet should work when using a library that the full qualified name of the packages are `org.some.library` and the artefact id is `custom-artefact-id`

[source, xml]
----
<plugin>
    <groupId>org.apache.maven.plugins</groupId>
    <artifactId>maven-shade-plugin</artifactId>
    <version>2.3</version>
    <configuration>
        <!-- custom shade configuration -->
        <artifactSet>
            <includes>
                <include>org.some.library:custom-artefact-id</include>
            </includes>
        </artifactSet>
        <relocations>
            <relocation>
                <pattern>org.some.library</pattern>
                <shadedPattern>org.some.library.new.pakage.name.shade</shadedPattern>
            </relocation>
        </relocations>
    </configuration>
</plugin>
----


=== Connector Structure

If you create your connector project using the DevKit Studio Plugin, the structure generates by default is the recommended approach.
If you are interested in more details, the project directory structure are described in the __Appendix C__.

In order to provide automatic enforcement of this rules, the following plugin must be configure as part of the connectors pom.xml. I will be responsible for validating the project structure.
Copy and paste the following snippets in your connector pom.xml:

[source,xml]
----
<build>
    ...
    <plugins>
        ...
       <plugin>
            <groupId>org.mule.certification</groupId>
            <artifactId>project-structure-validation</artifactId>
            <version>1.0.4</version>
            <executions>
                <execution>
                    <phase>package</phase>
                    <goals>
                        <goal>y</goal>
                    </goals>
                </execution>
            </executions>
        </plugin>
        ...
    </plugins>
    ...
</build>

== DevKit Standards and Best Practices
=== DataMapper Compliance

To have the best experience in Anypoint Studio, connectors must be DataMapper compliant. To achieve this, all operations must follow these recommendations.

Any argument, returned or received, must be one of the following data types:
. Map
. POJO
. List<Map>
. List<String>
. List<POJO>
. List<List<String>>

These types must be part of the method signature so that DataMapper can auto-recognize the types in it's mapping UI.

__Important__: Only use a map if you cannot use a POJO.
Only use a map if your data:
. Is schemaless, for example if created using MongoDB.
. Has user customizable schemas, if created with Salesforce.
. Has unknown content.


|===
|Good Example| Bad Example

|List<Map> query()| List<DBObject> query
|void send(Invoice invoice)| void send(Object object)
|Invoice getInvoice(String id)| Object get(String id, Class typeToCreate)

All operations must have a single object to take input from DataMapper. The object must be a single object, not multiple arguments. This object is called the Primary argument.
|===
|===
|Good Example| Bad Example

|void createInvoice(Invoice invoice)| createInvoice(Header header, List<LineItems> lineItems)
|void upsert(List<Map> sobjects, String type, String externalFieldId)| N/A - Multiple arguments are still needed!
|GetTaxResult getTax(TaxRequest request)|
```public GetTaxResult getTax(String companyCode, +
    AvalaraDocumentType docType, +
    @Optional String docCode, +
    Date docDate, +
    @Optional String salespersonCode, +
    String customerCode, +
    @Optional String customerUsageType, +
    String discount, +
    @Optional String purchaseOrderNo) +
```
|===

=== Annotations
If you have multiple arguments, annotate the Primary argument with:

`@Default("#[payload]")`

This way DataMapper knows which argument in the operation to use for mapping.

=== No Warning during compilation

DevKit does a intensive analysis of the used annotations and semantic of them in conjunction with others. Itâ€™s important the the code is free of compilation warning to help on the maintainability of the code and to follow good practices.
=== DevKit Generated API Doc

Connector documentation is composed of two different type of documentation: DevKit Generated DevKit API Doc and the Connector Documentation.

DevKit API Doc is automatically generated by DevKit based on the JavaDoc documentation at the connector class. This is one of the most important information used by the developer at the time of using the connector.

// @Todo: Hernan - Que sugeris ?. LDAP. We need to explain how to check the generated documentation.
// Recomendation with Samples


== Connector Demo Example

// @Todo: Paulo - Here we need to complete with Justin's input feedback.


A Mule application's endpoints allow a user to interact with the service and API using the connector. Endpoints are committed to the GitHub repository along with source code. Use services or API use cases to determine which connector operations to select.

Creation criteria:
. Ensure that an app can be run by entering credentials without additional configuration or connector installation.
. Use placeholders for credentials.
. Ensure that flow names and message processors display names that make the use case easy to understand.
. Provide instructions on how to run the app in the README.md file of the GitHub demo (example https://github.com/mulesoft/sqs-connector/tree/master/demo[SQS]).
. Expose a set of endpoints that the user can access following the steps in the README.md to reproduce a use case. An example is the https://github.com/mulesoft/sqs-connector/tree/master/demo[SQS] demo.
. Consider implementing a CRUD (or similar) use case with chained processors whose payloads get logged into the Studio console (for example, https://github.com/mulesoft/s3-connector/tree/master/demo/s3connectorstudiodemo[S3]).
. Use DataMapper for Standard or Premium connectors' CRUD (or a similar) use case if API methods attributes and/or return types allow it.
. Consider basic error handling in the Mule app.

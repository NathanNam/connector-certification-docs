= Anypoint Connector Certification Process

*version 0.9*



[[intro]]
= Certification

MuleSoft has expanded the Anypointâ„¢ Connector platform enabling partners, from out MuleSoft Partner Program, and third-party development groups, to develop Anypoint connectors.

Every connector in the MuleSoft Anypoint Platform must go through a mandatory *Certification Process* before final release. The certification process has been conceived to assess the overall quality of all available connectors, ensuring that every connector published in the MuleSoft's connectors repository strictly follow industry best practices. As a result of this certification process, we are able to define a high quality threshold for every Mulesoft connector available in the platform.

All available connectors, either built by our partners or by our internal development team, go through the certification process, which is carried out by Mulesoft's internal team. Once a connector passes certification, it is branded as a MuleSoft-certified connector and published in the MuleSoft's connectors repository.


The scope of this process mainly depends on the composition of the connector, where a more complex connector will require further step in the certification process. Our approach is to test every functional block of the connector prior releasing.



This document first introduces the entire *connector lifecycle model*, which includes four different stages: On-board, Development, Certification and Publishing.

. On-board: Takes into consideration the legal engagement between a third-party development group, or partner, and MuleSoft.
. Development: Development phase, considering strictly testing methodologies.
. Certification: The certification process per-se, carried out by a MuleSoft.
. Publishing: Considers the final deployment of the certified connector within MuleSoft's connectors repository. 

Within these stages, we only take into consideration the second and third: Development and Certification. The first stage in out of the scope of this document, while the last one hardly requires interaction from the developer's side and therefore it will be omitted.



//The following list gathers different high-level objectives to be acomplished during the certification of an Anypoint connector.


//. Automated code scan
//. Manual code review and black box testing
//. Manual and automated tests review
//. Repository structure review
//. Documentation review
//. Runtime-compatibility review
//. Static code analysis

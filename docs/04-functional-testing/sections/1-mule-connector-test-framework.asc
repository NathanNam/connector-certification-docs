[[_the_mule_connector_test_framework]]
=== The mule-connector-test framework

==== Objectives
. Provide consistent test suite implementation through the different connectors business models.
. Increase code reusability.
. Improve test case readability by encapsulating complexities.
. Reduce maintenance cost.
. Increase robustness by isolating test suite implementation from Mule classes changes.

=== Generate Functional Tests Scaffolding and Data using DevKit Plugin

DevKit Plugin provides mule-connector-test test data generation for functional test cases.

The framework described in this document consists of a series of automation tools, which let you run interoperability tests on a connector in Anypoint Studio. The framework covers Connectivity, Datamapper Compliance, and XML Generation tests, as described in the Connectors QA Guidelines. The data used by these tests is generated using not only a connectorâ€™s code, but also the output files in the DevKit, in particular the schema and editors file.

===  Anypoint Studio Plugin
==== Glossary of Terms
Runner Platform: Host where the test run takes place.
Target Platform: The platform (in terms of Anypoint Studio plugins) on which tests are going to that you run.
CUT: Connector under test

*-test-data-override.xml

==== Installation

===== Step 1: Check System Requirements
. http://maven.apache.org/download.cgi[Maven 3.2] or Greater
. http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/java-archive-downloads-javase7-521261.html[Java 1.7]

. Click Help > Install New Software.
. Click Anypoint Addons Update Site from the Work with drop-down.
+
NOTE: If this item is not in the dropdown, click Add and specify the name, and for the URL, use: http://studio.mulesoft.org/r4/addons/beta

. Click the checkbox for Anypoint DevKit Plugin, and click *Next, Next, Finish*.
. Restart Anypoint Studio when prompted.


=== Generating Functional Tests

==== Plugin Execution

With your connector imported in Anypoint Studio, right-click the project name in Package Explorer and click *Anypoint Connector > Generate Tests*.

The Test Scaffolding Generation dialog appears:

This lists:

. Processors found in the connector.

. The Generate Test Case Scaffolding option: This generates the TestCases.java classes, one for each processor, along with the classes you need to use the Functional Test Framework.

If a conflict exists between the existing files and the files you want to generate, a popup appears asking if the file should be replaced, or updated with the information related to new processors. This does not cover cases of signature change in the processor definition nor update of naming convention on existing Java classes.

Generated Files

Output files can be found under src/test/resources/generated. The actual convention is to have the files under src/test/resources, and the generated path is only expected to store files during development or those with constant modification.


==== Concepts
Use cases are built as a sequence of connector operations calls. Prior to running a use case, initialize a TestRunMessage and load the data required by the use case. After you invoke an operation, turn the content of the TestRunMessage into a MuleEvent before an operation consumes the content. Apply asserts to the payload of the operation under the test.

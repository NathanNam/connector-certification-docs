==== Topics to Test using JUnit

There are a few scenarios that need to be tested by means of JUnit tests instead of Functional tests. This sections describes those scenarios.

===== Test Connection

_Test connection_ test cases are derived from the error handling logic on each of the connector strategy classes. Check the following example:

- SalesforceBasicAuthStrategy.java class from the Salesforce Connector throws MalformedURLException and ConnectionExceptionCode (this exception can be break into many negative cases, like invalid credentials, expired credentials, etc)
- Validations are applied to the API version through verifyApiVersion method

The resulting cases should be taking into consideration and their corresponding *unit test cases* should be created. Assertions on the error messages should be applied to ensure that on error user is effectively informed of the cause of the problem.

Different set of credentials need to be used when testing valid and invalid test cases.

==== Introduction

Unit tests aim at assuring the correct behaviour of a particular code unit within the connector. Although not a mandatory step within the certification process, different aspects require unit tests instead of functional tests.

===== Test Organization

. Unit and Functional tests are ran separately. Unit tests are always run when executing _mvn clean install_. Grouping all unit tests within a test suite is up to the developer, although it is a good practice.

===== Naming Convention

. Unit tests should follow JUnit naming conventions, normally ending with _Test_ or _TestCase_. Any other ending will produce Maven Surfire plugin to skip these tests during installation.

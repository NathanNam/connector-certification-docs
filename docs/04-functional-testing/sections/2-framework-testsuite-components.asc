=== Connector Testing Framework Components

All functional test cases classes must extend from a FunctionalTestParent, as explained in the Connector Testing Framework documentation. This functional test parent is kept within the connector testing framework, which can be extended if further behaviour is required.

Every test case needs to be named as <OperationName>TestCases. These naming conventions avoid Maven to automatically run test cases, since tests require credentials and therefore automatically running them without the proper set of credentials will produce tests to fail.

==== <OperationName>TestCases Class

Each operation in the connector has an *<OperationName>TestCases.java* class that contains its related test cases.

[source,java]
----

import org.mule.tools.devkit.ctf.junit.FunctionalTests;

public class <OperationName>TestCases extends FunctionalTestParent {

   // private attributes used as auxiliary fields for storing test run values
   private Integer leadRecordId;

   // Extend parent setUp. Use to create required data for the test.
   @Before
   public void setUp() throws Exception {
     ...
   }

   // returns the sandbox to its original state
   @After
   public void tearDown() throws Exception {
      ...
   }

   //Method that invokes the connector operation under test and asserts on its payload
   @Category({FunctionalTests.class})
   @Test
   public void test<operationName>() {
      try {
         ...
      } catch (Exception e) {
        //Manage exception accordingly
      }
   }
}

==== Test Resources

. *automation-credentials.properties* stores the connector credentials and authenticated user related information.
. *required-libraries.properties* stores the list of required external Jars.

==== Test Development Environment Set Up

After building a connector, add *target/generated-sources/mule* to the project build path. You may need to add other generated sources to the build path depending on the connector (such as target/generated-sources/cxf).

If a connector is *Standard*, add a *muleLicenseKey.lic* to the *src/test/resources* folder and remove it prior to committing your changes.

==== Packages and Files

. *org.mule.modules.<connector-project>.automation.testrunners* contains the runner (FunctionalTestSuite).
. *org.mule.modules.<connector-project>.automation.testcases* contains the functional test cases exclusively.
. *<connector-project>/src/test/resources* contains the credentials file.


==== Keeping Headers Updated
Change the connector version to current to avoid breaking the configuration XML file, for example,

from: `http://www.mulesoft.org/schema/mule/taleo/1.0-SNAPSHOT/mule-taleo.xsd`

To: `http://www.mulesoft.org/schema/mule/taleo/current/mule-taleo.xsd`

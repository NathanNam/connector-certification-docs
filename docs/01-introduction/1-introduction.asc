== Certification Process

MuleSoft has expanded the Anypoint™ Connector platform enabling partners, from the MuleSoft Partner Program, and third-party development groups, to develop Anypoint™ connectors.

Every connector in the MuleSoft Anypoint™ Platform must go through a mandatory *Certification Process* before the final release. This certification process was conceived to assess the overall quality of all available connectors, ensuring that every connector published on the https://anypoint.mulesoft.com/exchange/[Anypoint™ Exchange] follows industry best practices. As a result of this certification process, we are able to define a high quality threshold for every Anypoint™ connector available on the MuleSoft platform.

The scope of this process mainly depends on the composition of the connector, where a more complex connector will require further steps in the certification process. Our certification approach aims at testing every functional block of the connector prior to release.

This document first introduces the entire *Connector Lifecycle Model*, which includes four different stages: On-board, Development, Certification and Publishing.

. *On-board:* Takes into consideration the legal engagement between a third-party development group or partner, and MuleSoft.
. *Development:* The development stage, considering strictly testing methodologies.
//todo: rephrase sentence about development
. *Certification:* The certification process per-se, carried out by a MuleSoft.
. *Publishing:* Covering the final deployment of the certified connector within Anypoint Exchange.

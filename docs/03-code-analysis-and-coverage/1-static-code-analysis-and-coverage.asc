== Static Code Analysis and Coverage
Most automatic validations on your connectorâ€™s code are done with SonarQube, an open source static code analysis tool that helps developers identify hot spots in code, bad code quality, technical debt, as well as define a number of other issues. To release a connector, you must fix blocker and critical issues.

To perform these validations yourself, install and configure a the SonarQube server that we provide with rules specific to the certification process. If you are certifying multiple connectors, you can reuse the same server.

NOTE: For guidelines on how to build your tests using this framework, see <<_functional_tests_automation,Automated Functional Testing>>

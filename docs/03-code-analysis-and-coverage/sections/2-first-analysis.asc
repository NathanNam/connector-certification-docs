=== Performing Your First Analysis

For the first run of your project, go to the project’s root folder and run:
----
mvn clean org.jacoco:jacoco-maven-plugin:prepare-agent test
	-Dmaven.test.failure.ignore=true -Dtest=RegressionTestSuite
	-D<connector>_CREDENTIALS=automation-credentials.properties
	&& mvn install && mvn sonar:sonar

mvn clean org.jacoco:jacoco-maven-plugin:prepare-agent
	install-Dmaven.test.failure.ignore=true && mvn sonar:sonar
----

This creates the project in your sonar installation, allowing you to use the Eclipse SonarQube plugin from inside your Anypoint™ Studio. Using this plugin is the recommended way, but is always possible to run the inspections manually with * mvn sonar:sonar *.

If you are experiencing false positive issues, you can disable the inspection using //NOSONAR comment at the end of a line which has the issue on a case-by-case basis. Every use of //NOSONAR is recorded by SonarQube as an Info issue so you can track its usage in your connector’s code.

NOTE: The use of *//NOSONAR* comments should only be used when there is full certainty that this inspection is a false positive.

For example, suppose you have an incorrectly capitalized method that you can’t change. This is normally a blocker issue:

After adding the *//NOSONAR* marker, this is no longer a blocker issue, but is marked as Info so you can track the usage of //NOSONAR throughout your project:

=== Installing SonarQube

The quickest way to get SonarQube up and running is to install it locally with an embedded database. If you wish to use a standalone database or a more advanced configuration, see the related SonarQube Eclipse Plugin Setup documentation.

You need a server running Oracle JRE 6 or higher. (OpenJRE or other distributions are not supported by SonarQube.)

. Download and extract the latest version of http://www.sonarqube.org/downloads[SonarQube](all platforms).
. Run __<installDir>/bin/<yourOS>/sonar.sh start__ or __<installDir>\bin\<yourOS>\StartSonar.bat__ if on Windows. The server might take a while to start even after the “Started SonarQube” message appears.
. Browse to http://localhost:9000.
. Log in with the following credentials:
.. Username: admin
.. Password: admin
. Download our link:files/quality-profile.xml[Custom Quality Profile]
. Go to the *Quality Profiles* tab and Click *Create*.
. Then choose the *Quality Profile* file that you downloaded, name it "Anypoint Connectors Profile" and click *Create*.
. When you see the profile in the list click in *Set as Default*.
. Finally you need to set the exclusions, to set this go to *Settings* and click *Exclusions*.
. In the *Code Coverage* tab add __target/**__
. Click *Add Value*  and click *Save Code Coverage Settings*.
. In the *Files* tab add __target/**__ under __Global Source File Exclusions__ and __Global Test File Exclusions__.
. Finally, click *Add Value* in both and click *Save Files Settings*.

|Steps|Description|Expected result
|1|Configure both connectors with an operation returning and/or having an attribute of type POJO / List<POJO>, Map<String,POJO>, or List<Map<String, Object>>.|Metadata is fetched for both configurations.
|2|On the DataWeave element click "Scaffold output structure" and accept.| "Select fields to scaffold" dialog type matches the Input Metadata of the processor (attribute annotated with @Default("#[payload]"))
|3|Select all and click Ok|Scaffolding for the Input Metadata is written out automatically, Transformation and Output section reflect the changes
|4|Click on the Structure tab of the Output section| Input Metadata of the processor is reflected
|5|In the Input section select the payload and click on Sample data| Additional Payload tab is displayed that shows a sample input with placeholders for its fields.
|6|Click on Regenerate sample data and accept.|"Select fields to use in sample data generation" dialog type matches the Output Metadata of the processor
|7|Select all fields and accept| payload tab content is updated

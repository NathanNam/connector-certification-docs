== Coding Standards and Best Practices

Development best practices and coding standards have been learned within the connector development community over time, leading to improve the quality of connectors. During the cerfitication process, most of these practices and standars are checked through automated tools, such as SonarQube.


=== Anypoint™ Connector DevKit Version

The last version of Anypoint™ Connector DevKit must be used to develop your connector. As of March 2015, the latest stable Devkit version is 3.6.1.

DevKit 3.6.x assures that a connector will be compatible with Mule ESB 3.5.x and Mule ESB 3.6.x. However, external libraries employed by the connector might have conflicts with different Mule ESB versions. Samity checks are mandatory for every Mule ESB Version.

=== Connector Category

There are four types of categories with different support policies:

* Premium
* Select
* Standard
* Community

Further information about connector categories can be found http://www.mulesoft.org/documentation/display/current/Anypoint+Connectors#AnypointConnectors-ConnectorCategories[here].

A connector should define its category in the POM properties:

[source, xml]
----
<groupId>org.mule.modules</groupId>
<artifactId>mule-module-sample-connector</artifactId>
<version>1.0.0-SNAPSHOT</version>
<name>Mule Sample Connector </name>
<packaging>pom/packaging>

<properties>
    <category>Select</category>
    <licensePath>LICENSE.md</licensePath>
    <devkit.studio.package.skip>false</devkit.studio.package.skip>
</properties>
----

If a connector is categorized under **Select**, then the connector code must include the **@RequiresEnterpriseLicense** annotation.

If a connector is categorized under **Premium**, then the connector code must include both the **@RequiresEnterpriseLicense** and the **@RequiresEntitlement** annotations.
